## 🧾 Summary

| Task | Concept |
|------|--------|
| 1    | Port Scanning (Nmap) |
| 2    | Service Enumeration |
| 3    | Redis Fundamentals |
| 4–5  | CLI Usage |
| 6–7  | Information Gathering |
| 8–10 | Redis Commands |
| 11   | Data Extraction |

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Redis often runs without authentication → major security risk.
- Misconfigured services can directly expose sensitive data.
- Always enumerate services thoroughly after port scanning.
